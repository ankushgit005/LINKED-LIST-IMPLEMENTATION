Linked List

A linked list is a fundamental data structure used in computer science to store a sequence of elements. Unlike arrays, linked lists do not store elements in contiguous memory locations. Instead, each element (called a node) stores its own data and a pointer (or reference) to the next node in the sequence.

Structure of a Linked List
A typical node in a singly linked list has two parts:

Data – The value or information stored in the node.
Next – A pointer to the next node in the list.
In C programming, a node is often defined as:

c struct Node { int data; struct Node* next; };

The first node of the linked list is called the head, and the last node points to NULL, indicating the end of the list.

Types of Linked Lists
There are different types of linked lists:

Singly Linked List – Each node points to the next node only.
Doubly Linked List – Each node has two pointers: one to the next node and one to the previous node.
Circular Linked List – The last node points back to the first node, forming a circle.
Operations on Linked Lists
Linked lists support various operations:

Insertion – Add a node at the beginning, end, or in between nodes.
Deletion – Remove a node from the list.
Traversal – Visit each node in the list to read or display its data.
Search – Find whether a specific value exists in the list.
Update – Change the data value of a specific node.
Here’s an example of traversing a singly linked list in C:

c void display(struct Node* head) { struct Node* temp = head; while (temp != NULL) { printf("%d -> ", temp->data); temp = temp->next; } printf("NULL\n"); }

Advantages of Linked Lists
Dynamic Size: Unlike arrays, linked lists can grow or shrink in size during program execution.
Efficient Insertions/Deletions: Nodes can be added or removed without shifting other elements.
Memory Usage: No need to allocate memory for the entire list at once.
Disadvantages of Linked Lists
Slower Access: To access a particular element, traversal from the head is required.
Extra Memory: Each node requires additional memory for the pointer.
Complex Implementation: Compared to arrays, linked lists are more complex to implement and manage.
Applications of Linked Lists
Dynamic memory allocation
Implementation of stacks, queues, and graphs
Symbol tables in compilers
Undo functionality in editors
Browser history navigation
Conclusion
A linked list is an efficient data structure used for flexible memory management and fast insertions/deletions. Understanding linked lists is important for building more complex data structures and mastering algorithmic problem-solving. Though they may seem complex at first, linked lists offer a strong foundation for understanding how data is organized and manipulated in many real-world applications.Linked List
